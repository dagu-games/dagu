item rarities
common - 1 trait
uncommon - 2 traits
rare - 3 traits
epic - 4 traits
legendary - 5 traits
mythic - 6 traits

total points for item = 6 + level of character
points for first stat = total * ((50+random(50))/100.0)
total -= points for first stat
points for next stat = total * ((50+random(50))/100.0)
on last stat, dump remaining total

all stats are first normalized through an algorithm such that any stat can be infinitely large but normalized to logarithmic numbers that get ever closer to 100
all stats therefore get normalized to effectively 0-100

damage = attack_base_damage + (attack_damage_multiplier * (attack_power/attack_resistance) * random(attack_random_factor))
return (damage*(attack_lifesteal/100)) health to attacker

health is given straight up, with a simple multiplier to balance, giving regeneration on tick, same as mana
