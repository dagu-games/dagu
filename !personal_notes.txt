chunk generation
generate random number r
if r < chance_of_town
    generate town with npcs with shops and quests that are available and not selected
else
    if you have any quests
        generate wilderness or dungeon relevant to quest, ie monsters you need to kill, monsters holding goal items, monsters holding general materials, named dungeon to clear
    else
        generate true random wilderness or dungeon





item rarities
common - 1 trait
uncommon - 2 traits
rare - 3 traits
epic - 4 traits
legendary - 5 traits
mythic - 6 traits


total points for item = 6 + level of character
points for first stat = total * ((50+random(50))/100.0)
total -= points for first stat
points for next stat = total * ((50+random(50))/100.0)
on last stat, dump remaining total


all stats are first normalized through an algorithm such that any stat can be infinitely large but normalized to logarithmic numbers that get ever closer to 100
all stats therefore get normalized to effectively 0-100


damage = attack_base_damage + (attack_damage_multiplier * (attack_power/attack_resistance) * random(attack_random_factor))
return (damage*(attack_lifesteal/100)) health to attacker


health is max 100 base, 200 max, same as mana
